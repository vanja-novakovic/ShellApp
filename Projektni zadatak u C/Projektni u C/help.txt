In this app, available commands with their prototypes are:
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
login - allows user to log in, so he could use the full scope of commands.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
where - shows the path to the current directory in which the logged in user is currently
        working in.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
go (path) - changes current directory. Directory that is supposed to be new current directory is 
	    command line argument - (path).
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
create [-d] (name or path) - creates a new directory / file by following the path. If the -d parameter
			     exists, creates a directory, otherwise - a file. If only the name is given
                             (instead of the path), then a new directory / file is created in the 
			     current directory. 
*Note: If file with the same name already exists, it will be overwritten.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
list [path] - lists the contents of a directory on a given path (or current directory if no path is 
              specified). It prints the entire directory (including files) tree, whose root is given 
              (or current) directory.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
print (file) - prints the contents of a text file to the console.  
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
find ("text") (file) - searches the file in order to find the given text. If the text is found, command 
 		       returns the number of line in the file where the text first occurred.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
findDat (file) (path) - searches the directory tree whose root is specified as a path, and looks for 
                        a file that has the same name as the first command line argument.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
clear - clears the console screen
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
logout - enables user to log out, so he could perhaps log in again with different account without exiting 
         the app. 
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
exit - closes the app
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________

  Ordinary brackets are there to denote mandatory arguments.
